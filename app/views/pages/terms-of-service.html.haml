This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction.

      %h2 DISPUTES

In particular, any feedback with regard to the subscription service must be submitted in writing within 14 days after the start of the billing cycle, failing which Tengence shall accept no responsibility.
      %p Tengence will try our best to resolve your Claims in 30 days. If we are unable to do so, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
      Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any claims you assert against us.
      %p Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. You will be responsible for the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
      %p To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to "42race Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager," at 77 Van Ness Avenue, Ste 101-1806, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. A party requesting arbitration must also provide a copy of the request to the AAA.
      %p Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.

      %h2 SEVERABILITY
      %p In the event that any provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.
